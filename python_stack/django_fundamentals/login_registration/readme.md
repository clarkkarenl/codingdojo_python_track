2018-07-24

Rebuild the Login and Registration assignment from the flask chapter, this time using Django.

Weâ€™ve learned how to integrate models, validations, and controllers to our projects. Our next goal is to create a fully functional login and registration app! This will combine your knowledge of MVC patterns, validations, and password encryption.

Build the following:
* Show validation error messages if validations fail the following tests
** First Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
** Last Name - Required; No fewer than 2 characters; letters only
** Email - Required; Valid Format
** Password - Required; No fewer than 8 characters in length; matches Password Confirmation
* Bonus: Birthday Field - Before today, or go creative and do it in an age range
* Bonus: Implement Flash Messages
