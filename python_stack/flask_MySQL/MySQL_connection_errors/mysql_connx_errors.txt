#1 - incorrect password
Issue:
Input the wrong password in the config, when accessing index.html received:
- OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1045, "Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)") 
Fix:
Update config['password'] with the correct value

#2 - incorrect port
Issue:
Input the standard port into the config. However, my instance is running on a different port
- OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (10061)")
Fix:
Update config['port'] with the correct value

#3 - hardcoded database
Issue:
I copied the mysqlconnection.py file from another project in which the config['db'] name was hardcoded
- OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1049, "Unknown database 'otherdb'")
Fix:
Restore the config['db'] value to "db" so that the database can be passed in by server.py.

#4 - comment out the database line in the config file
Issue:
I commented out the database line in the config file to see what would happen.
- This site canâ€™t be reached
localhost refused to connect.

ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
Fix:
This was a fun one, because Flask couldn't even serve index.html with the database line missing from the config. Restoring the line solved the problem.
